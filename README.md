# DispatchDesk

DispatchDesk is a **lightweight ticketing and work-order system** designed for small teams that need structure without enterprise bloat.  
The project is being built **API-first**, with a strong focus on data modeling, workflow clarity, and long-term extensibility.

This repository currently contains the **backend service only**. A front end may be added later, but is not required to interact with the system.

---

## Project Goals

- Provide a clean, well-structured API for managing:
  - Tickets
  - Work orders
  - Status transitions
  - Assignments and history
- Emphasize **correctness, clarity, and maintainability** over feature sprawl
- Serve as a real-world backend systems project, not a toy demo

---

## Tech Stack

**Backend**
- FastAPI (Python)

**Database**
- PostgreSQL

**ORM**
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 (modern, typed, explicit)

**Migrations**
- Alembic

**Authentication**
- JWT (access + refresh) *or* session cookies  
  *(Final approach will be chosen during implementation)*

**Testing**
- Pytest

**Deployment**
- Render **or** Fly.io  
- Hosted API + managed Postgres

**Documentation**
- OpenAPI (auto-generated by FastAPI)
- This README (source of truth for project intent)

## Current Status

🚧 **In Progress — MVP LIVE on Render**

The main branch is now live on Render (see link bellow). New workflow features are being develped on week-4-workflows.

### Deployment

DispatchDesk is deployed as a Dockerized FastAPI service on Render [DispatchDesk](https://dispatchdesk.onrender.com).

- The API is built from a Dockerfile
- Database migrations are applied automatically on startup via Alembic
- Configuration is provided entirely through environment variables
- A managed PostgreSQL instance is used in production

Local development uses docker-compose to run the API and Postgres together.

- Integrations with external ticketing platforms

These may be explored later, but are intentionally out of scope for the initial build.
